 Responsible for CSS and overall usability for the site.
 You will see some span headers within this file and other html files.
 These span headers include the text color and the font type.
 I realize something that I could've done better would be to write a span class
 in the bootstrap.css file so that it could be used universally through the HTML pages.
 I also created a CSS file called backgroundcolor.css which allowed me to add specific
 colored backgrounds to different aspects of the webpages. For example, we have the
 index page which has a white background around it, so it could be differentiated from
 the actual background color. Something else I had to make sure all the different pages being added
 had the correct color with the markdown page as well we have the ability for when a different
 page with a different title will continue to stay the same color no matter what the text says.
 The things that I have changed has been able to be very versatile with many features that
 we have added including the preview ability on the categories page.
 So basically in conclusion here is a list of things that I have done:
 - Added a CSS page for changing the background color of the website (color listed below)
 - Changed background color to #1f6377
 - Changed text color to #ff8c00
 - Changed the font to JetBrains Mono ExtraBold
 - Made sure that all the text color was the same throughout the site as to keep consistency
 - Added the ability to change text color of the main content of an article to the main web pages text color
 - Added a white background to some tables as to show a difference in the background color such as in the index page
 - Added vertical dividers between the navigation bar buttons to show space and a more filling sense to the bar
 - Changed text color of navigation buttons as well as the Add, Move, Edit, Delete buttons to the sites main color
 - Made sure the text color in the preview was presenting with color as the actual page
 - Changed it so that the text color of the search page with the results correctly displays
 Changes that could be improvements:
    - Set the text color and the font in the css page so it could be used universally when new pages are added
    - Removing the home page's delete button
    - Adding an ability to insert images into a new page when a user creates one
    - Hovering over page title gives a brief description of a page
